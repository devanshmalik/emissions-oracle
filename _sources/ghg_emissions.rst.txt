Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimate Methodology
===============================================

This page aims to provide details on the methodologies used and assumptions made for the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions (emissions calculations, assumptions, etc.).

All estimates in this analysis are aimed to account for the entire life cycle of the electricity generation.
The Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) help quantify the environmental burdens from "cradle to grave" and facilitate more-consistent comparisons of energy technologies.

Life Cycle Emissions
------------------------

Generalized life cycle stages for each energy technology include:

1. **Upstream**: Resource Extraction, Material Manufacturing, Component Manufacturing, Construction
2. **Fuel Cycle**: Resource Extraction / Production, Processing / Conversion, Delivery to Site
3. **Operation**: Combustion, Maintenance, Operation
4. **Downstream**: Dismantling, Decommissioning, Disposal and Recycling

The proportion of GHG emissions from each lifecycle stage differs by technology:

- For fossil-fueled technologies, fuel combustion during operation of the facility emits the vast majority of GHGs.
- For nuclear and renewable energy technologies, most GHG emissions occur upstream of operation.

Emissions Factors
-------------------

An Emissions Factor is a representative value that attempts to relate the quantity of GHG emissions released to the
atmosphere with the amount of electricity generated by a certain source (can be any activity that releases GHG emissions).

- For example: Nuclear Power has a Total Life Cycle Emissions Factor of 13 kg CO2e per MWh of electricity generated (source: NREL). This means that for every MWh of electricity generated, Nuclear Power releases 13 kilograms of CO2 equivalent GHG emissions.
- CO2 "Equivalent" emissions is a metric used to compare the emissions from various GHGs on the basis of their global-warming potential (GWP). Basically, not every GHG contributes equally to global warming.
    - For example: Methane has a GWP of 25 which means that 1 kg of Methane is equivalent to 25 kg of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.

**The biggest caveat when working with emissions factors values is that they can differ drastically based on tons of factors considered within the specific study.**
Thus, to **reliably** estimate the GHG emissions for each energy source, GHG emissions factors were obtained from the `Life Cycle Assessment Harmonization Project <https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/life-cycle-assessment.html>`_
by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) that considered approximately 3,000 published life cycle assessment studies on utility-scale electricity generation.

Special Cases: Coal and Natural Gas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned earlier, fuel combustion during operation is the vast majority of GHGs for fossil-fueled generation. Instead of using the median emissions factors values for Coal and Natural Gas for the Combustion stage
from the NREL study above, a more accurate method was utilized.

- From the EIA API, fuel consumption data for both coal and natural gas was pulled for each state. This data represents the amount of heat from the specified fuel used for electricty generation.
- Emissions factors for each fuel were pulled from another API called `ClimatIQ <https://docs.climatiq.io/>`_ which hosts an `Open Emission Factor Database <https://github.com/climatiq/Open-Emission-Factors-DB>`_.

This approach is more accurate because every coal / natural gas generation plant has a different efficiency in how much fuel is needed to generate a unit of electricity. Thus, by using the exact amount of
fuel used (instead of the final amount of electricity generated), we're able to more accurately estimate the associated GHG emissions.
