Project Assumptions
=======================

With any machine learning project, there are always assumptions associated with any decision made throughout the training process.
The forecasted electricity generation and emissions for each region / generation source make many implicit assumptions
that are not reflective of the real world.

Some of these assumptions include:

- Lack of data on Power Purchase Agreements(PPA), life of electricity generation assets such as Nuclear Power Plant refurbishments / shutdown, signing of new PPAs for certain technologies, etc.
- Worldwide factors affecting energy demand such as Covid-19 Pandemic, War in Ukraine, etc.
- New policies coming into affect (either discouraging dirty fuels or boosting greener generation sources)
- And many more...

Hence, any of the forecasted estimates in this analysis should be taken with a grain of salt.
